    ourStory: "The Wheelchair Tennis Team at the University of Virginia was started in late 2021 by Catherine DeSouza and Mason McGrady who combined to bring collegiate adaptive sports to Virginia for the first time ever. While initially only having one student-athlete for the entire of the 2021-22 tennis season, UVA has since grown into one of the largest collegiate wheelchair tennis programs in the country boasting four student-athletes and two coaches. Now, the team is challenging for a national title in Orlando, Florida every year – which if won – would be the first adaptive championship in UVA’s history.  ", 
    theNeed: "As a powerhouse in collegiate athletics and renowned academic institution, the University of Virginia (UVA) stands tall among its peers. Yet, we saw an opportunity to enrich its legacy even further by embracing the spirit of inclusion and accessibility through the creation of an adaptive sports program. We believe that in the future, a comprehensive adaptive sports program would open doors for students with disabilities, providing them with opportunities to thrive athletically, academically, and socially. And by promoting inclusive sports, UVA can foster a culture of diversity and respect, reflecting its values as a forward-thinking institution dedicated to the holistic growth of its student body. The UVA Wheelchair Tennis Team is the first step in this journey."
